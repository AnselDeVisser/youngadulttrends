		<section> <br> <p> As these eras are the manifestation of the changing trends in the publishing industry, there is a transition phase between the 2010s era and the 2020s era. It starts around 2013 and continues to about 2018 or 2019. This era started to diverge from the supernatural romances and dystopias of the 2010s but hadn’t quite reached the fantasy romance of the 2020s era. I personally can’t think of a lot of books from this era that are super well known or definitive, or at least not to the same extent as the 2010s has Twilight and the Hunger Games and the 2020s has Sarah J. Maas. This might be because there isn’t much here to be definitive. The defining feature of this period is that it was transitioning between the 2010s to the 2020s and it had combinations of traits from both of those eras. There were most often the storylines from the 2020s era with characters more similar to the 2010s. The other way around could also be found. This time period also has some books that fit clearly into the 2010s era or the 2020s era, which is why I have emphasized throughout this that the year ranges are more of guidelines than actual rules. </p> <br>

<p>With how YA has been in the past two years, I believe that YA is coming up on another transition phase. Each era lasts about 5-7 years, and the 2020s era has now lasted for about 6 years. Also, the 2010s era ended in about 2013, and it is currently 2024. It’s been a decade since the start of the last transitional phase for YA and I think YA is long due for a new one. The trends for fantasy tend to be aging out of YA and into what’s known as New Adult or just into the fiction section so that seems to be where popular fantasy books are moving to. This may be as the people reading that era of YA are also aging and are looking for more mature books, content, and characters. What I think YA is transitioning towards currently is murder mysteries, thrillers, and horrors or romance. Either way, I think the next YA genres are going to be more grounded in reality and have less fantasy and sci-fi elements. It’s hard to predict where exactly it will go as the publishing industry changes, but I do think that YA is entering a new transition phase and, in a few years, YA will be in a new era. I don’t know what the new era will be, and I don’t know what the definitive books for the new era and the transitional phase will be, as this transitional phase is just starting to begin. Only time will tell.
