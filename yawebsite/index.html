		<section> <br> <p> Before we get too far into this, a disclaimer. I don’t have sources for any of this. All of the points I’m making are from my own opinions and experiences reading. This means most of it is limited to fantasy and dystopia from young adult. My viewpoint is also different since I didn’t start reading YA novels until around 2015-2017, so I have seen the development of YA after that far more and almost first hand. Anything before 2015, I have only seen the aftermaths of and what books have stuck around or what the library I used had from that time period. My personal biases are here. I am not trying to be unbiased. I just want to share my opinions on YA and how it has changed in the time I have been reading it. There are not sources for any of what I’m about to say. This is extremely limited to what I read in YA which was limited to what the library I was at owned. That means this is not a great representation of all YA, just what I’ve witnessed. This is so incredibly biased, and I am not avoiding that because that’s not what this is for. I’m having fun with this, not being serious and scientific. Now let’s get started. </p>

<br>

<p>Young Adult as a category follows many trends. In this, I will be focusing on the ones I have noticed, which is from somewhere around 2005-2007 to present day. There are two sections within this time. The first I will refer to as the 2010s era and it lasts from roughly 2006 to 2013. The second section I will refer to as the 2020s era which lasts roughly 2018 and is ongoing. These are not set definitions and there are books from outside of the years I listed that fit the trends for those years. These are rough definitions and the lines between eras are blurred easily. The years between 2013 and 2018 are what I refer to as the grey zone or transition era. Books from this period have characteristics of both the 2010s era and the 2020s era. Some lean more towards one era than the other but they still don’t really fit either era. </p>


<br>
<p>From what I have observed and how long each era seems to last, I believe that YA is coming up to a new transition era soon. Each era is anywhere from 5-7 years long and the current one has lasted about 6 years. To me, this means that YA is likely starting to transition to a new era in the next few years. Murder mysteries, thrillers, and horror seem to have been becoming more popular and they may be the direction YA is transitioning to for the trends. However, I’m not sure yet and to know for sure, we will have to wait and see.
