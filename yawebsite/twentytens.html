<section> <br> 
<p>The 2010s era of YA runs from around 2006 to 2013. I think the true start of the era is around 2007 but it does go a bit earlier than that. It’s a very reminiscent era for many people, particularly those who grew up during this era and those who read these books as their first introduction to YA. It’s also a time period where books are being marketed towards teen girls specifically, which is a good thing. Previously, things were marketed for teen boys which also teen girls should be interested in because men are viewed as the default. This is actually unfortunately common. Girls are expected to enjoy books written for boys but boys aren’t expected to enjoy books that are written for girls because how could they possibly relate to the main character of those books? With books now being marketed at teen girls specifically, the YA market starts to change. </p> <br>

<p>The two defining series for this era are the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyers and the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. This era has so many copies of each of these series. Supernatural romance with vampires, werewolves, demons, angels, or other similar beings were very popular as well as dystopian novels. The dystopias mostly followed a consistent pattern where the main character finds out some horrible secret, starts a rebellion, and takes down the government, all within only three books. Trilogies were big at the time. The literary equivalent of a training montage where the main character gets good impossibly fast were also very common. Many of these books were trying to copy the Hunger Games and its popularity, but most of them failed to reach the same depth to them that helped the Hunger Games be so successful. This doesn’t make them bad books. It simply means they weren’t the Hunger Games like they were trying to be. </p> <br>

<p>In this era, there was very little character diversity. The character type known as Mary Sue was very common, because many of the main characters were blank slates who were good at everything and maybe socially awkward for relatability to allow teen girls to project themselves onto these characters. Most books were about cisgender heterosexual white girls falling in love with cisgender heterosexual white boys. The main character tended to be trying to not be like other girls and emphasizing how different she was from other girls. <em>Oh, she’s not pretty like other girls, she doesn’t wear makeup like other girls, she’s not obsessed with boys like other girls, she doesn’t dress like other girls, </em> and so on. If you were lucky, maybe you’d get a fat best friend, or a Black best friend, or a gay best friend. The diverse characters were put to the side to only make the main character seem better or to add drama. You can find books with diverse characters but rarely in the two of the biggest genres of the time and even more rarely as the main characters. </p> <br>

<p>I haven’t even discussed the romance sub plots or main plots yet. They tended to be love triangles between generic man #1 and generic man #2. More specifically, it tended to be blond childhood friend and black haired broody possessive bad boys. The blond childhood friends were often the ones rejected in favour of the toxic bad boy. The childhood friends were often also toxic. Don’t you just love a good love triangle where neither of the options are ones you cheer for the relationship with? These books probably aren’t great representations of good relationships or anything to base real life relationships off of. </p> <br>

<p>Some people think that YA should have good healthy relationships in it to help teenagers learn what is good in relationships. Some people think YA should portray unhealthy relationships as unhealthy and stop romanticizing them like is so common. I think it’s a complicated situation and I think people shouldn’t be relying on books to teach teens how good relationships look. If teens can understand that fantasy isn’t real and that there are things in books that wouldn’t be good in real life, then people should be having conversations with them about what good relationships do look like. They should have people around them modelling that for them. Not all teens have that because the world is not a perfect place. I still think books should be discussed because books present ideas and concepts and those should be discussed. Not necessarily all books, but at least some of them. I think it would help people practice critical thinking and analyzation of text, which in today’s world is an increasingly more important skill with misinformation, ragebait, and fake news being more and more common. This is a tangent and not really all that connected, but I don’t think people should rely on fiction to show what healthy relationships are in every book. I think there’s some sort of middle ground and I don’t know what it is. But I also think that it’d be really weird and bad to try to control what people write. Freedom of thought and expression and all that. It’s an important thing. </p>
