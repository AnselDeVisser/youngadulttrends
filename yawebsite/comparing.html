	<tr> <td> Time Period </td> <td> 2006-2013 </td> <td> 2018-2023</td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Main Characters </td> <td> Mary Sues that are perfect at everything with maybe social awkwardness. Blank slates to allow teen girls to project onto them. </td> <td> More capable and self assured. Doesn't need a man to protect her. Still blank slates and Mary Sues. </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Love Interests </td> <td> Love triangles between the blond childhood friend and the black haired broody possessive bad boy. Both toxic options. </td> <td>  Protective and possessive but supportive of crimes. Less love triangles, more enemies to lovers. Sometimes just mean and cruel but “it’s because he loves her”. </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Side characters </td> <td> Main diversity can be found in the best friend who's only there to make the main character seem better or to add drama. </td> <td>  More diverse overall and they tend to have more ofan important role in the story than just making the main character look better. </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Genres </td> <td> Supernatural romance or dystopia. </td> <td> Fantasy, romantasy, or fairytale retellings. </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Storylines </td> <td> Taking down the government or falling in love with a supernatural being that puts you at risk by simply loving them. </td> <td> Political intrigue with a royal family or a quest plot. </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> Settings </td> <td> Urban fantasy settings or postapocalyptic dystopian settings. </td> <td> High fantasy mostly. Occasionally an urban fantasy setting. </td> </tr>
